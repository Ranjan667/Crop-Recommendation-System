# Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## üåü Project Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based application designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in selecting the most suitable crops for their land. By analyzing soil and environmental conditions, the system offers data-driven recommendations to optimize yields and maximize profitability.
